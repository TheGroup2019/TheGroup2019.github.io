      <p style="color:#01426a;">Q: How is the lunch?.</p>

    A: That depends on you. If you like anything and are willing to taste new wthings then great! If not and you're a picky eater, it is safe to giveout a warning to bring a few snacks. For real though, lunch sometimes is really good. We've had pizza, olive garden pasta and more but just in case that it isn't, there's a mezzanine area where you can buy too just in case!
