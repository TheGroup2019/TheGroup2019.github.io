In the Girls Who Code program, we went on a total of three field trips, three mentor panels and had 5+ guest speakers. For the field trips, we went to a Royal Caribbean Cruise, Venture City, and the University of Miami. For the field trips, we got to go on an actual cruise and eat lunch on the cruise. It was cool, except for the part that they didn't let us jump into the pool. The other field trip we went to an office, but it was a cool office. It had unicorns, iguanas, skateboards and two dogs. Other than all that fun stuff they showed us how to come up with an effective way to brainstorm for ideas. The last field trip we went to the University of Miami. It was cool, they gave us a tour of the university and we also got to visit the 3D printing lab and we got to play with Magic Leap.

The mentor panel consisted of women, although most of them didn't hold any tech experience. However, they provided useful advice that will stick with you for the rest of your life. Also, you learn new terms like bio breaks. The majority of the guest speakers, unlike the mentors, held tech positions. They were nice, some of them gave us stickers and water bottles. The guest speaker that stood most was Christina Kelly.

Overall this program was really fun and it will be an experience that will stick with us for the rest of our lives. The topics we learned and the advice we received will help us in the future as we pursue our dreams.
