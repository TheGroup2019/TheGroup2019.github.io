    Python is the next programming language you learn in GWC EY. Despite it's complex appearence, it's quite a very simple program.
    But unlike Scratch, Python is text-based, so you need to actually type out conditionals, loops, and variables.
    As previously mentioned, Python is text-based coding, rather than visual. Python also tells you where specifically an error in your code is.
    Once your teacher has taught you the basics for python, you'll need to apply them to the following projects.
    <h3>Text Adventure Story</h3>

    Remember the CYO adventure game you made on scratch with your partner? Now with that same partner, you'll be build that same story on Python.
    This project is super easy now that you both have a story to code on, rather than coming up with a new one. You'll also get to add more choices to your story,
    as you will notice coding it in isn't so hard. This project is, in my opinion, both relaxing and fun because you can expand your story. It's my second favorite project in python.
    With the extra time, you can make it funnier, darker, tragic, or whatever it is you and your partner want to achieve. A little tip to keep your story interesting: add a twist to your characters,
    every 2 or 3 choices the player makes.
    <h3>Guess the word</h3>

    <p><center>
      <p style="color:Gray;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;font-size:18px;">
    For this project, you'll make a hangman game. After you've made your list of words, you have to code the guesses for your player to make.
    This project is a little hard, so don't worry if you can't exactly get it right. As long as you get close, it's okay. Not everyone in my class was able to get it right.
    A little tip: don't put too many words on your list. Start with 2 or 3 words, completely different from each other(i.e. [Red, Yellow, Blue]).
    This way, testing your game is easier for you. Then, if everything works, you can add more words for your hangman. Once again, don't freak out if it doesn't work for you.
    It's a pretty hard project. If you do complete it, congratulations to you.
    <h3>Chatbot</h3>

    No you are not creating an AI(or at least not in GWC, maybe you might in the future). You're building a chatbot, which is making the computer interactive.
    It's a little hard at first, but once you understand concepts like parameters, and creating functions, all you'll really need is your imagination. If you need some starter ideas,
    here's one. Come up with a funny intro, a couple of questions for your user, and an equally funny wrap up. Somedays, the best way to entertain your audience is through laughter.
    If you don't understand parameters or functions just yet, feel free to do the following project. I didn't understand these concepts either, until I did the next project.
    <h3>Mad Libs</h3>

      <p style="color:Gray;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;font-size:18px;">
    For those who may not know Mab Libs, it's a game where you tell a story, and fill in some words with your own nouns, verbs, and adjectives.
    You can find the lyrics to a song you like and change a couple of words to make it funny or weird. You can practice making functions and parameters when making this game.
    The parameters are whatever words you'd like the user to put in, and the function is how the story is presented with the chosen parameters. It's a really good way to fully understand
    functions and parameters, which will help you a lot with your chatbot project(see project above). It's my favorite project on python, along with the Chatbot.
    <h3>Filters</h3>

    The last project of the week is to apply a filter on an image by coding. This project is also a little tough, but it can be accomplished.
    Depending on the filter you'd like to apply on your image, it may take some amount of coding, and some math operations.
    Only simple math operations, such as greater an, equal to, and less than. Be sure to also have your image in the same folder as your python projects.
    In my opinion, this project is a medium difficulty. Personally, the first half was easy, but then the second half was a little difficult. But it was super cool
    applying the filter to image. Despite the tough spots, it's a pretty fun project, and my third favorite.
