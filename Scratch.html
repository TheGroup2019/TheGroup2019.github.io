    This is Scratch. It's the first lesson for every GWC program and it's quite simple.
    It uses visual coding, which is a fantastic start, because it will be easier to apply it on text-based coding.
    Below are the projects we have worked on during our program. They're all pretty simple and to the point.
    <h3>All about me</h3>
    <img width="400", height="300" src="Me.gif" alt="">

      <p style="color:Gray;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;font-size:18px;">
    The "All about me" project is your first project of the program, and as mentioned in it's title, it's about you.
    It's a very simple and all you have to do is code a story about yourself and at least 3 facts about yourself to share with your classmates.
    The purpose of this project is to get you and your classmates to know each other more and start out with basic coding.
    You don't need a mega long or a super awesome story for your story. Just an intro and 3 facts is fine(i.e. "Hello my name is Keren Rivera. I am a junior, I'm an ambivert, and I like purple.")
    As long as your main sprite works, you finished working. If you have extra time, add more sprites and facts about yourself to make your project look better.
    <h3>So you think you got moves</h3>

      <p style="color:Gray;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;font-size:18px;">
    This is a cool project and it's not hard. Here, you are making two spites compete against each other in a dance off. You will also have people vote for a winner.
    On this project, you are testing your loops on all competing sprites and making a score variable so the audience determines a winner.
    Don't stress about making your sprites dance much. A simple one-two minute routine is perfect on at least two sprites and extras such as discos and music will make your project a blast.
    For me it was a cute project because the dancing is nice. Plus everyone's dance competition is different and cool.
    <h3>Fortune teller</h3>

    <p><center>
      <p style="color:Gray;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;font-size:18px;">
    My personal favorite project. The title says it all, you're making a online fortune teller.
    You know how in a paper fortune teller, you pick the color(i.e. Blue(b-l-u-e)),
    then you pick a number(i.e. 4(count to 4)), and finally you pick a second number(i.e. 2(count to 2)) to get to your fortune?
    Well, you are going to do that, but on scratch. You will use conditionals to get to a fortune you write.
    It's a really fun project because you may run into funny fortunes.
    These conditionals are later applied to another project will build as well. (Hint: It's the next scratch project we will discuss about.)
    <h3>CYO Story(Choose your Adventure)</h3>
    <img width="500" height="300" src="CYO.jpg" alt="">
    <br>
    image source=https://patriotpost.us/digests/7374-brief

      <p style="color:Gray;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;font-size:18px;">
    This is just like the fortune teller project, only this time it's a story. You will also work with a partner for the CYO story.
    A little tip for your story: don't add too many choices. Start with 8 simple choices using a flow chart(i.e. choice1: choice3 or choice 4, choice 2: choice5 or choice6, etc).
    You don't need a big story. A small story with 8 different outcomes is a good amount to code and have everything working.
    If you have extra time, you are more than welcome to add more outcomes to your story if you and partner want to.
    This project is also really fun because you start working with someone and you both can come up with an awesome story.
    <h3>Maze Game</h3>
    <img width="500" height="400" src="Maze2.gif" alt="">
    <br>
    image source=https://www.colourbox.com/vector/maze-vector-3057548
    <p><center>
      <p style="color:Gray;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;font-weight: 300;font-size:18px;">
    Your last project with scratch is the maze game.
    Everything you've learned so far comes together. Conditionals, variables, loops, etc., are going to be applied all together.
    You will also be working with a team of about 3-4 people. You will all work on different parts of the project so your final maze is able to be played.
    A little tip(as cheesy as it may be) is to communicate with your team about your progress and any troubles you may run into. Maybe someone there knows how to fix it.
    This maze is another fun one because testing out the maze is awesome. Depending on how hard you made the maze, you or your team may not even complete it.
